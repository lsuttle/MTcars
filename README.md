Files for the report for the Project for the "Regression Models" Course.

I posted them here for two reasons:

* Uploading the PDF hid all the code and I thought it might have been
interesting to make that available, perhaps to get some feedback.

* The strict and silly page limit on the PDF forced me (and probably everybody else)
to butcher things to make the report fit the constraints.

Let me add that I am not against page limits per se.  
They make sense in many situations, and certainly in my life as a researcher 
I have dealt with them both as a writer and a reviewer of proposals.  
They serve a purpose.

What I found silly in this case is that the Rmarkdown-to-PDF workflow does not
leave much control at all on the formatting of so many essential parameters,
and the poor writer is left without many options, other than senselessly cutting
and shrinking and butchering text and plots and whatnot. 
Not to mention how much time I had to spend just for that... 

**It make very little sense imposing a limit on something on which the author has basically no control!!**

As a matter of fact it conflicts head-on with one of the basic principle
behind the idea of Rmarkdown (markdowns in general), that is to streamline the
workflow by separating all formatting concerns from the act of writing a report.
